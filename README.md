# MNIST-drawing
Trains a simple CNN on MNIST data in the trainModel.py file, and saves it as a .keras file. Then, the draw.py file lets the user test out this model by presenting them with a window to draw a single digit. With the predict button, the model will then try to predict what the user drew.

## Features
- CNN trained on MNIST using TensorFlow/Keras
- Simple digit drawing interface for testing

## Requirements

- Python 3.13
